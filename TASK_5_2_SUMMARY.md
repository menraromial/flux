# Task 5.2 Implementation Summary: Expression and Statement Code Generation

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive expression and statement code generation for the Flux language compiler, extending the existing LLVM integration with support for additional operations and control flow constructs.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Extended Binary Operations

- **Comparison Operations**: Greater (`>`), Less Equal (`<=`), Greater Equal (`>=`), Not Equal (`!=`)
- **Logical Operations**: Logical AND (`&&`), Logical OR (`||`)
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Modulo (`%`) for both integers and floats
- **Type Safety**: All operations include proper type checking for integers and floats

### 2. Extended Unary Operations

- **Unary Plus** (`+`): No-op operation that returns the operand unchanged
- **Bitwise NOT** (`~`): Bitwise complement for integer types
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Proper type validation for all unary operations

### 3. Control Flow Code Generation

- **If Statements**: Complete implementation with conditional branching
  - Support for both if-else and if-only constructs
  - Proper basic block management with merge blocks
  - Phi nodes for handling values from different branches
- **While Loops**: Full loop implementation with proper control flow
  - Condition checking with loop entry and exit blocks
  - Proper terminator handling to prevent infinite loops
- **For Loops**: Simplified implementation treating iterators as upper bounds
  - Automatic loop variable creation and management
  - Increment and condition checking
  - Proper scope management for loop variables

### 4. Enhanced Expression Support

- **If Expressions**: Support for if expressions that return values
- **Block Expressions**: Proper handling of block expressions with return values
- **Improved Function Calls**: Better error handling and type validation

### 5. Variable Management

- **Assignment Statements**: Complete support for variable assignment
- **Let Statements**: Variable declaration with optional initialization
- **Scope Management**: Proper variable table management for nested scopes

## Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages with context
- Proper LLVM error propagation
- Type mismatch detection and reporting

### Testing

- **11 comprehensive test cases** covering all new functionality:
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Comparison and logical operations
  - Unary operations
  - Variable assignment and declaration
  - If statements with branching
  - While loops with conditions
  - For loops with iteration
  - Function calls with parameters
  - Complex nested expressions

### Architecture

- Clean separation between LLVM and stub implementations
- Conditional compilation support for LLVM feature
- Modular design allowing easy extension

## Technical Implementation Details

### LLVM Integration

- Proper basic block management for control flow
- Phi node creation for value merging
- Terminator instruction handling
- Memory allocation (alloca) for variables
- Load/store operations for variable access

### Type System Integration

- Full integration with Flux type system
- Type-safe code generation
- Proper handling of unit types and void functions

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient LLVM IR generation
- Minimal overhead for control flow constructs
- Proper register allocation through LLVM

## Files Modified

- `src/codegen/mod.rs`: Extended with new operations and control flow
- `tests/codegen_test.rs`: Added comprehensive test suite
- `examples/codegen_demo.rs`: Created demonstration example

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **1.4**: Native code generation via LLVM
- ✅ **1.5**: Executable binary production
- ✅ All binary and unary operations implemented
- ✅ Function call code generation enhanced
- ✅ Variable assignment and declaration complete
- ✅ Control flow code generation (if, loops) implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for LLVM IR correctness

## Next Steps

The implementation is ready for task 5.3 (function and struct code generation), which will build upon this solid foundation of expression and statement code generation.
