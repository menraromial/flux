# Task 6: Basic Runtime System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive basic runtime system for the Flux programming language, including memory management foundation and concurrency runtime basics.

## Task 6.1: Memory Management Foundation ✅

### Implemented Features:

#### 1. Enhanced Garbage Collector
- **Mark-and-sweep algorithm** with proper object tracking
- **Object header structure** with metadata for GC operations
- **Heap allocation and deallocation** functions with error handling
- **Memory allocation tracking** for debugging and profiling
- **Configurable GC settings** (heap thresholds, auto-GC, detailed tracking)

#### 2. Object Header Structure
```rust
pub struct ObjectHeader {
    pub marked: bool,           // Mark bit for GC
    pub size: usize,           // Object size including header
    pub type_id: u32,          // Runtime type information
    pub generation: u8,        // For future generational GC
    pub ref_count: u32,        // Reference counting for debugging
    pub allocated_at: u64,     // Allocation timestamp
}
```

#### 3. Memory Allocation Features
- **Type-safe allocation** with automatic type ID generation
- **Manual deallocation** for explicit memory management
- **Root object management** for GC roots
- **Memory reuse** through free list (foundation for optimization)
- **Allocation statistics** by type and overall usage

#### 4. Debugging and Monitoring
- **Detailed allocation tracking** (optional, performance-aware)
- **Memory usage statistics** with peak tracking
- **GC performance metrics** (collection time, objects collected)
- **Memory summary reports** with comprehensive information

### Key Components:
- `GarbageCollector` - Main GC implementation
- `ObjectHeader` - Object metadata structure
- `Heap` - Low-level memory management
- `GcConfig` - Configuration options
- `AllocationTracker` - Debug tracking system

## Task 6.2: Concurrency Runtime Basics ✅

### Implemented Features:

#### 1. Enhanced Scheduler
- **Multi-threaded scheduler** with configurable worker threads
- **Round-robin scheduling** algorithm
- **Goroutine state management** (Ready, Running, Blocked, Finished)
- **Work-stealing architecture** with worker thread pool
- **Thread-safe operations** using Arc<Mutex<>> patterns

#### 2. Goroutine Management
```rust
pub struct Goroutine {
    pub id: GoroutineId,
    pub stack: Stack,
    pub state: GoroutineState,
    pub context: Context,
    pub function: Option<fn()>,
}
```

#### 3. Channel Operations
- **Buffered and unbuffered channels** with configurable capacity
- **Thread-safe send/receive** operations
- **Non-blocking try_send/try_recv** operations
- **Channel closing** and state management
- **Channel cloning** for multi-producer/multi-consumer patterns

#### 4. Scheduler Features
- **Automatic worker thread management** based on CPU count
- **Goroutine spawning** with handle-based tracking
- **Yield and blocking** operations for cooperative scheduling
- **Statistics collection** for performance monitoring
- **Graceful shutdown** with worker thread coordination

### Key Components:
- `Scheduler` - Multi-threaded goroutine scheduler
- `Goroutine` - Lightweight execution unit
- `Channel<T>` - Type-safe communication primitive
- `Context` - Execution context for goroutines
- `Stack` - Goroutine stack management

## Testing Coverage

### Memory Management Tests (15 tests)
- GC creation and configuration
- Object allocation and deallocation
- Type-safe allocation with type IDs
- Root object management
- Garbage collection execution
- Memory tracking and statistics
- Allocation debugging features
- Error handling (out of memory)
- Memory summary reporting

### Concurrency Tests (22 tests)
- Scheduler creation and configuration
- Goroutine spawning and execution
- Multi-threaded worker management
- Channel operations (send/receive)
- Channel state management (close, capacity)
- Scheduler statistics and monitoring
- Blocking and yielding operations
- Integration testing with actual execution

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- **Configurable thresholds** for GC triggering
- **Optional detailed tracking** to minimize overhead
- **Memory reuse** through free list implementation
- **Efficient mark-and-sweep** with minimal pause times

### Concurrency
- **CPU-aware worker threads** (defaults to CPU count)

## Next Steps

The basic runtime system is now complete and provides a solid foundation for:

1. **Error Handling System** (Task 7) - Can leverage the memory management for error objects
2. **Standard Library** (Task 8) - Can use channels and GC for I/O and collections
3. **Advanced Concurrency** (Task 11) - Can build on the scheduler for async/await
4. **Performance Optimization** (Task 14) - Can tune GC and scheduler parameters

The implementation follows Rust best practices with comprehensive error handling, thread safety, and extensive test coverage. All tests pass successfully, confirming the reliability of the runtime system.
